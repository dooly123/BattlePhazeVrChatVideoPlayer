Warning, this is not done yet and contains some bugs but should mainly work fine!!
for quick setup just drop the videoPlayerPrefab into your scene.

attached to the parent of the video player is the helper script i built this to assist with generating the video & speaker setup among RPC control, 
however due to limitations of unitys Callback system for preplay linking i cannot setup audio linking among a few other things.

things that are in the works but are not functioning:
 3D support , Emission Support, Legacy Video Player
